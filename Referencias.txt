We have used several sources of information and knowledge to make the most complete and professional Lab we could:
1. Class Repository: The official repository provided by the teaching team, which includes materials, examples, and resources related to the course and its assignments.
The url is: https://github.com/oliver-seliom/DIS.git

2. Practice 1: We have used some files such as Tourism.java and TouristController.java from the previous Lab.

3. Dockerization Assignment: A previously completed activity as part of the course, focusing on creating Docker containers, configuring Dockerfiles, and enabling communication between applications through containers. 
This assignment provided the foundation for dockerizing both the backend and frontend applications.

4. Artificial Intelligence
